Calculates transaction gas costs based on current Ether pricing and set gas limit/price.

<h2>Instructions:</h2>

<b>Gas Limit:</b> Set the amount of gas you are willing to use for a transaction.
Normal transactions should use 21000 gas limit, while other types of smart contracts (i.e. ICOs) may use a lot more.

<b>Gas price:</b> Set the price (in gwei) you are willing to pay for each unit of gas. 
Higher prices ensures your transactions get prioritized by the miners in order to get validated sooner.
